## How to Use This Skill

### For Prompt Analysis
```
"Review this prompt and suggest improvements:
[YOUR PROMPT]

Focus on: clarity, specificity, format, and consistency."
```

### For Prompt Generation
```
"Create a prompt that:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

The prompt should handle [use cases]."
```

### For Custom Instructions
```
"Design custom instructions for an agent that:
- [Role/expertise]
- [Key responsibilities]
- [Behavioral guidelines]"
```

### For Troubleshooting
```
"This prompt isn't working well:
[PROMPT]

Issues: [DESCRIBE ISSUES]

How can I fix it?"
```

- No redundancy
- Progressive disclosure
- Token efficiency

### Consistency
- Defined constraints
- Specified format
- Clear guidelines
- Repeatable results

### Completeness
- Sufficient context
- Edge case handling
- Success criteria
- Error handling

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Refining Vague Prompts
Transform unclear prompts into specific, actionable ones.

### 2. Creating Specialized Prompts
Design prompts for specific domains or tasks.

### 3. Designing Agent Instructions
Create custom instructions for AI agents and skills.

### 4. Optimizing for Consistency
Improve reliability and reduce variability.

### 5. Debugging Prompt Issues
Identify and fix problems with existing prompts.

### 6. Teaching Best Practices
Learn prompt engineering principles and techniques.

### 7. Building Evaluation Frameworks
Develop test cases and success criteria.

### 8. Multimodal Prompting
Design prompts for vision, embeddings, and files.

## Best Practices Summary

### Do's ✅
- Be clear and specific
- Provide examples
- Specify format
- Define constraints
- Test thoroughly
- Document assumptions
- Use progressive disclosure
- Handle edge cases

### Don'ts ❌
- Be vague or ambiguous
- Assume understanding
- Skip format specification
- Ignore edge cases
- Over-specify constraints
- Use jargon without explanation
- Hardcode values
- Ignore error handling

## Advanced Topics

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Encourage step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks.

### Few-Shot Learning
Use examples to guide behavior without explicit instructions.

### Structured Output
Use XML tags for clarity and parsing.

### Role-Based Prompting
Assign expertise to guide behavior.

### Prompt Chaining
Break complex tasks into sequential prompts.

### Context Management
Optimize token usage and clarity.

### Multimodal Integration
Work with images, files, and embeddings.

## Limitations

- **Analysis Only**: Doesn't execute code or run actual prompts
- **No Real-Time Data**: Can't access external APIs or current data
- **Best Practices Based**: Recommendations based on established patterns
- **Testing Required**: Suggestions should be validated with actual use cases
- **Human Judgment**: Doesn't replace human expertise in critical applications
